            <p>
            For a few weeks I worked on a project called QuickNotes. They're essentially the same as
            Windows 7's sticky notes, where you could open up a little window on your desktop and type
            in it to give yourself reminders, or take notes in.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
            However, I wanted to differentiate my program from sticky notes a bit, so I decided to
            add the option to save a note that you find particularly important or long, for added
            convenience.

            <img src = "/Assets/quickNotesTwo.PNG" alt = "A screenshot of a note being saved">
            <p>Click the save button on a note...</p>
            <img src = "/Assets/quickNotesThree.PNG" alt = "A screenshot of a saved note being reopened">
            <p>And it'll be there whenever you press the saved note button!</p>
            <p>(Unfortunately the save button only saves the text in your most recently created note.
                Coding is hard.)
